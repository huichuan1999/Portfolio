            <h2>Week 1</h2>
            <h3>12-Oct-2023</h3>
                    <p>This week, I decided to continue my previous research direction, 
                        which is: what makes people perceive the creatures I generate with a computer as genuinely lively. 
                        After researching a series of works, 
                        <a href = " https://medium.com/@REAS/notes-on-phototaxis-db7aa7641ad8">an article by Casey Reas on Medium</a>, 
                        sparked my interest in exploring the <a href = "https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262521123/vehicles/">Braitenberg vehicle</a>. 
                        I noticed that even the most initial models like vehicle1, and vehicle2a and 2b, 
                        exhibit entirely different behaviors due to different sensor connection methods - 
                        people often project subjective imaginations onto them, such as fear, aggression, 
                        liking, and love. This is quite fascinating, so I am currently trying to reproduce 
                        them using code. However, I quickly found that at the level of constructing the code 
                        logic framework, it is difficult for me to precisely define sensors and motors, 
                        and sometimes sensors are not even necessary. Ultimately, 
                        it turned out to be akin to some simple particle systems, 
                        only involving some more accurate vector mathematics between the targets and the vehicles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moving forward, I plan to continue auditing courses in physical computing,
                         learning how to use Arduino on my own, and based on the 
                         <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle">Braitenberg Vehicle's original definitions</a>, 
                         striving to create these vehicles physically and tangibly.
                          I also intend to conduct experiments on various surfaces because I want to 
                          introduce more elements of chance, such as varying degrees of surface roughness,
                           different inclinations, and variations in light intensity, etc. 
                           Bringing all of these elements into the physical realm can facilitate 
                           better observation and adjustment of these uncertain variables. 
                           At the same time, I find this to be a thoroughly enjoyable process. 
                           It feels as if I am creating a lively toy that belongs to me. 
                           On a theoretical level, I am delving deeper into reading related 
                           literature such as 'Contingent Computation', further exploring the element 
                           of chance in computational art, and contrasting it with the randomness encountered 
                           in my previous fine art experiments (e.g., the trembling of a hand while painting,
                            the flow of paint in water, the texture of the canvas, different material brushes,
                             and so on)."
