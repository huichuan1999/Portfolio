            <h2>Week 1</h2>
            <h3>12-Oct-2023</h3>
            <p>This week, I decided to continue my previous research direction,
                which is: what makes people perceive the creatures I generate with a computer as genuinely lively.
                After researching a series of works,
                <a href=" https://medium.com/@REAS/notes-on-phototaxis-db7aa7641ad8">an article by Casey Reas on
                    Medium</a>,
                sparked my interest in exploring the <a
                    href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262521123/vehicles/">Braitenberg vehicle</a>.
                I noticed that even the most initial models like vehicle1, and vehicle2a and 2b,
                exhibit entirely different behaviors due to different sensor connection methods -
                people often project subjective imaginations onto them, such as fear, aggression,
                liking, and love. This is quite fascinating, so I am currently trying to reproduce
                them using code. However, I quickly found that at the level of constructing the code
                logic framework, it is difficult for me to precisely define sensors and motors,
                and sometimes sensors are not even necessary. Ultimately,
                it turned out to be akin to some simple particle systems,
                only involving some more accurate vector mathematics between the targets and the vehicles.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moving forward, I plan to continue auditing courses in physical computing,
                learning how to use Arduino on my own, and based on the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle">Braitenberg Vehicle's original
                    definitions</a>,
                striving to create these vehicles physically and tangibly.
                I also intend to conduct experiments on various surfaces because I want to
                introduce more elements of chance, such as varying degrees of surface roughness,
                different inclinations, and variations in light intensity, etc.
                Bringing all of these elements into the physical realm can facilitate
                better observation and adjustment of these uncertain variables.
                At the same time, I find this to be a thoroughly enjoyable process.
                It feels as if I am creating a lively toy that belongs to me.
                On a theoretical level, I am delving deeper into reading related
                literature such as 'Contingent Computation', further exploring the element
                of chance in computational art, and contrasting it with the randomness encountered
                in my previous fine art experiments (e.g., the trembling of a hand while painting,
                the flow of paint in water, the texture of the canvas, different material brushes,
                and so on)."
            </p>

            <h2>Week 3</h2>
            <h3>12-Oct-2023</h3>
            <p>
                This week, I started exploring a few directions that piqued my interest. 
                The p5.js code related to the Braitenberg Vehicle is finished,
                 but I am preoccupied with some exhibition collaborations recently, 
                so I haven't started on the physical computing part yet.
            </p>
            <p>
                In previous discussions with teachers and classmates when sharing my work, 
                I've been inspired a lot. 
                I was repeatedly asked why I'm so fascinated with simulating life forms and natural laws. 
                I answered that, firstly, I'm deeply drawn to the aesthetics of microscopic photography: 
                These tiny, primitive life forms appear transparent and exquisite, 
                possessing a surprising vitality. 
                Secondly, I'm captivated by certain commonalities between life, 
                humans, and machines. However, someone pointed out that I, 
                too, am a life form, and we humans are part of the natural laws, 
                with no real barriers separating us from them. 
                When I create these simulations, I am, in fact, 
                indulging in the pleasure of playing a creator. 
                This is something I had vaguely considered but didn't want to admit 
                because I don't wish to introduce too much politics and power into my work. 
                Yet, it's an intriguing thought, and I will continue exploring this perspective. 
                I will no longer shy away from the topic of 'politics' as it's inescapable—even genuine 
                biological labs have their politics. Perhaps it's time to delve deeper into understanding 
                what true post-humanism really means, 
                and the role 'power' plays in my creative process.
            </p>
            <p>Additionally, learning Max.msp has familiarized me more with the patterns of coding. 
                I've come to realize that sound art is a realm I've never ventured into. 
                While I have a smattering of classical piano training, 
                it might not necessarily qualify as sound art. 
                What defines good sound art? I've decided it's time to delve into this, 
                trying to craft something using this software.
