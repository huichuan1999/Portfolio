            <h3>12-Oct-2023</h3>
                    <p>This week, I decided to continue my previous research direction, which is: what makes people perceive the creatures I generate with a computer as genuinely lively. After researching a series of works, an article by Casey Reas on Medium, https://medium.com/@REAS/notes-on-phototaxis-db7aa7641ad8, sparked my interest in exploring the Braitenberg vehicle. I noticed that even the most initial models like vehicle1, and vehicle2a and 2b, exhibit entirely different behaviors due to different sensor connection methods - people often project subjective imaginations onto them, such as fear, aggression, liking, and love. This is quite fascinating, so I am currently trying to reproduce them using code. However, I quickly found that at the level of constructing the code logic framework, it is difficult for me to precisely define sensors and motors, and sometimes sensors are not even necessary. Ultimately, it turned out to be akin to some simple particle systems, only involving some more accurate vector mathematics between the target and the vehicle.</p>
