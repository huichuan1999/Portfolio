            <h1><b>MFA Second year Weekly Blog</b></h1>
            <h2>Week 1</h2>
            <h3>12-Oct-2023</h3>
            <p>This week, I decided to continue my previous research direction,
                which is: what makes people perceive the creatures I generate with a computer as genuinely lively.
                After researching a series of works,
                <a href=" https://medium.com/@REAS/notes-on-phototaxis-db7aa7641ad8">an article by Casey Reas on
                    Medium</a>,
                sparked my interest in exploring the <a
                    href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262521123/vehicles/">Braitenberg vehicle</a>.
                I noticed that even the most initial models like vehicle1, and vehicle2a and 2b,
                exhibit entirely different behaviors due to different sensor connection methods -
                people often project subjective imaginations onto them, such as fear, aggression,
                liking, and love. This is quite fascinating, so I am currently trying to reproduce
                them using code. However, I quickly found that at the level of constructing the code
                logic framework, it is difficult for me to precisely define sensors and motors,
                and sometimes sensors are not even necessary. Ultimately,
                it turned out to be akin to some simple particle systems,
                only involving some more accurate vector mathematics between the targets and the vehicles.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moving forward, I plan to continue auditing courses in physical computing,
                learning how to use Arduino on my own, and based on the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle">Braitenberg Vehicle's original
                    definitions</a>,
                striving to create these vehicles physically and tangibly.
                I also intend to conduct experiments on various surfaces because I want to
                introduce more elements of chance, such as varying degrees of surface roughness,
                different inclinations, and variations in light intensity, etc.
                Bringing all of these elements into the physical realm can facilitate
                better observation and adjustment of these uncertain variables.
                At the same time, I find this to be a thoroughly enjoyable process.
                It feels as if I am creating a lively toy that belongs to me.
                On a theoretical level, I am delving deeper into reading related
                literature such as 'Contingent Computation', further exploring the element
                of chance in computational art, and contrasting it with the randomness encountered
                in my previous fine art experiments (e.g., the trembling of a hand while painting,
                the flow of paint in water, the texture of the canvas, different material brushes,
                and so on)."
            </p>

            <h2>Week 2</h2>
            <h3>12-Oct-2023</h3>
            <p>
                This week, I started exploring a few directions that piqued my interest.
                The p5.js code related to the Braitenberg Vehicle is finished,
                but I am preoccupied with some exhibition collaborations recently,
                so I haven't started on the physical computing part yet.
            </p>
            <p>
                In previous discussions with teachers and classmates when sharing my work,
                I've been inspired a lot.
                I was repeatedly asked why I'm so fascinated with simulating life forms and natural laws.
                I answered that, firstly, I'm deeply drawn to the aesthetics of microscopic photography:
                These tiny, primitive life forms appear transparent and exquisite,
                possessing a surprising vitality.
                Secondly, I'm captivated by certain commonalities between life,
                humans, and machines. However, someone pointed out that I,
                too, am a life form, and we humans are part of the natural laws,
                with no real barriers separating us from them.
                When I create these simulations, I am, in fact,
                indulging in the pleasure of playing a creator.
                This is something I had vaguely considered but didn't want to admit
                because I don't wish to introduce too much politics and power into my work.
                Yet, it's an intriguing thought, and I will continue exploring this perspective.
                I will no longer shy away from the topic of 'politics' as it's inescapable—even genuine
                biological labs have their politics. Perhaps it's time to delve deeper into understanding
                what true post-humanism really means,
                and the role 'power' plays in my creative process.
            </p>
            <p>Additionally, learning Max.msp has familiarized me more with the patterns of coding.
                I've come to realize that sound art is a realm I've never ventured into.
                While I have a smattering of classical piano training,
                it might not necessarily qualify as sound art.
                What defines good sound art? I've decided it's time to delve into this,
                trying to craft something using this software.

            </p>

            <h2>Week 3</h2>
            <h3>26-Oct-2023</h3>
            <p>
                Starting from late September, I've had the privilege of collaborating with artist Liu Xin. Our joint
                project has now entered an intensive phase, focusing on finalizing details and coordinating personnel
                exchanges.

                This marks my first part-time job in London, and it's gratifyingly aligned with my professional skills
                and abilities. My role extends beyond that of an illustrator and graphic designer; I am also
                contributing as a computer artist.
            </p>
            <p>
                For me, this is an unprecedented and exhilarating experience.

                In the project, I am primarily responsible for creating the visual content for the LED displays, editing
                videos, and designing the overall layout for glass stickers. The process, from initial sketches and
                coding frameworks to the final completion, has been incredibly fulfilling.
            </p>
            <p>
                Working with Liu Xin has been an enlightening journey; she's an exceptionally talented artist.

                Her background in mechanics and engineering, quite distinct from the purely artistic backgrounds of my
                friends, brings a structured rhythm to life, something I've deeply appreciated while working in her
                London studio.

                She shared with me that, as artists, maintaining a healthy lifestyle—eating well, staying hydrated,
                keeping a regular sleep schedule, and taking timely breaks—is crucial. This disciplined approach, vastly
                different from our typically chaotic lifestyles, I believe, is a positive step forward and greatly
                beneficial for mental well-being.
            </p>
            <h2>Week 4</h2>
            <h3>9-Nov-2023</h3>
            <p>
                Today, our project officially launched at the Shanghai Biennale in the West Bund Art Museum. I feel a
                tremendous sense of accomplishment. Although we faced many unforeseen challenges during the final phase
                of the project, we managed to resolve them effectively, and the results were impressive.
            </p>
            <p>
                My learning journey with Max.msp has entered a new phase. I've learned to use nodes for basic facial
                recognition tasks, transforming facial positions on the canvas into elements like colors and sounds. The
                mindset required for node-based programming is similar yet distinct from traditional coding. Instead of
                memorizing syntax, I need to understand the function of each node and what it can achieve.
                Although I had some prior experience with Unity's visual scripting, Max.msp often surpasses my initial
                understanding, because it contains lots of sounds data processing and debugging can be less
                straightforward. However, for quickly creating prototypes,
                visual scripting is much faster than traditional coding.
            </p>
            <p>
                Meanwhile, I'm working part-time as a creative coding teaching assistant at my alma mater, the Central
                Academy of Fine Arts. It's an engaging role, where I teach third-year students with no coding background
                how to write code using p5.js. I've introduced them to fundamental concepts and AI-assisted tools like
                ChatGPT. For students who are likely to pursue careers in visual or fine arts, learning to drive AI to
                assist with coding and achieve previously unattainable results is vitally important.
            </p>


            <h2>Week 5</h2>
            <h3>23-Nov-2023</h3>
            <p>
                On November 20th, another one of my exhibitions opened in Beijing, China. This marks the first time in
                my career as an artist that I've started participating in exhibitions far and wide, prompting me to
                seriously contemplate what exposure means for an artist. While it might seem a bit repetitive to talk
                about these things, I believe it's extremely important to document these feelings.
            </p>
            <p>
                As many know, my previous research focused on virtual, computer-generated life. I've joked with friends
                that I wish to be a cybernetic life form living inside a smartphone. However, recently, remotely
                coordinating with friends in China to set up my exhibition has been a challenging task. Video calling
                friends to guide them through setting up my exhibition, instructing them on how to configure my programs
                and devices, I felt akin to an electronic pet.

                I was unable to do anything by myself; I couldn't physically adjust the placement of cameras on the
                display stands or change the viewpoint of the video call. How bright are the lights in the exhibition
                hall? What kind of atmosphere do the dimensions of the screen create? I couldn't experience or adjust
                these aspects firsthand.

                I had to convey all information verbally to my friends, reminiscent of the process of programming—a
                computer doesn't know anything and will only do what you tell it to. In this scenario, my friends were
                the computer.

                Moreover, the entire process was as anxiety-inducing as programming, prone to bugs, as
                communication between people isn't always straightforward. I had to convey my instructions in the most
                efficient and understandable manner possible.

                Interestingly, this made me feel the process was quite computational. At the same time, it led me to new
                reflections on the feedback loop discussed in control theory.
