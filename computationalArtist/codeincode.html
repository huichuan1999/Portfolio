        <p>
            "Code in Code" is an artistic exploration that weaves together three
            distinct languages â€“ the human natural language of text input, the computer
            programming language, and the expressive language of visual forms embodied
            in L-systems. This project represents my ongoing journey into the realm of
            computer graphics, with a particular focus on the study of fractals.
        </p>
        <p>
            The process begins with the audience's textual input, which is first
            transformed into sounds; each keystroke resonates with a corresponding
            piano note, creating an auditory backdrop. These inputs are then sent via
            OSC to TouchDesigner. Here, they undergo transformations as Python scripts
            algorithmically transcribe them into L-systems signs, finally in the creation
            of intricate and symmetrical 2D visuals.
        </p>
        <p>
            During a reflective afternoon, I found myself pondering the profound
            relationship between language and code. As I manipulated symbolic commands,
            guiding the aimless path of Lindenmayer's turtle, I contemplated how
            characters like F, +, -, !, /, and [] are not merely instructions. They
            are an expression of my intent to mold fractal patterns, akin to crafting
            a unique vocabulary. Each function I define and invoke is like weaving a
            precise and fashionable word into a dialogue. It's comparable to directing
            the turtle with instructions such as F+[F]-[F], a dance of commands that
            translates to a step forward, a turn right, and a retreat to the starting
            point for a turn left. This project is more than coding; it is a symphony
            of interaction, a bridge connecting my creative vision with the computer's
            interpretation.
        </p>
        <p>
            At this point, "Code in Code" delves into the inversion, mapping, and
            transformation among these languages. The project binds these elements
            through a nodal connection, where the OSC wireless transmission protocol,
            alongside nodes and lines in Max and TouchDesigner, narrates a visual,
            logical, and linguistic resonance. This exhibition stands as a testament
            to the harmonious integration and mutual influence of diverse forms of
            expression in the digital era, inviting the audience to witness a dialogue
            between human creativity and digital interpretation.

        <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
        <p>
            At first, I was merely fascinated by the patterns generated by mathematics, which led me to
            start learning more about the subject recently. Despite my weak math foundation, I have
            gained a wealth of knowledge from friends who are experts in the field. For instance, I've
            always found fractal shapes like the Mandelbrot set and Julia set magical but elusive.
            When watching other people's shaders, I discovered that the x and y axes on our canvas
            can directly represent the complex numbers'a and b axis(c = a + bi), and many people have
            used these formulas and theorems to create beautiful graphics with shaders. But for me to
            comprehend what math and shaders working is too hard.
        </p>
        <p>
            I began learning TouchDesigner from scratch and delving deeper into Max/MSP. These tools
            are much more powerful than p5.js, which I am most familiar with; they are fast, use GPU
            rendering, and have fewer bugs. They seemed tailor-made for visual artists like me. However,
            after going through a series of tutorial videos, I felt a bit tired. Although I could easily
            create seemingly pretty graphics with various ready-made nodes, it didn't bring me the joy
            I had anticipated. They also seemed more homogenized compared to creative programming. Too
            many people were creating similar visuals with similar nodes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Suddenly, I noticed the L-system SOP, which I had researched in p5.js last year. In code,
            changing it seemed a bit troublesome, but in TD, it appeared that I could do much more. I
            started to read its documentation to understand its syntax.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I mentioned earlier, even simply commanding the turtle how to crawl, I consider it a
            language. I wanted to try translating our everyday human language to it. Initially, I set
            up a series of complex mapping rules (such as mapping text length to iterations, letter
            frequency to rotation angle, and first and last letters to branching rules, etc.) but
            quickly got overwhelmed. Being a beginner, I couldn't manage such complexity in a short time, so I resorted
            to the most conventional way. I simply assigned the symbols F, +, and - to
            the 26 uppercase and lowercase letters. This rule seemed simple, but it was the most feasible
            solution I could come up with in the limited time I had. These symbols could be combined in
            any order, and the computational load was not too heavy. Even with many generations added, it
            wouldn't crash my computer. So, I decided to use my text input, trying to chang this string of
            expressions in real time.
            I made a p5.js sketch here:
            <br>
            translate text to L-system code: https://editor.p5js.org/huichuan1999/sketches/eMjgn7GKg
            <br>
            but it is not enough.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the help of my teacher, I successfully achieved the transmission of textual information
            from Max to TouchDesigner. I'm immensely grateful to Olivier for his assistance! In addition,
            I experimented with the jit.linden and jit.turtle objects in Max/MSP to implement the L-system
            and attempted to create some visuals. However, I found that their potential for visual iteration
            and development was significantly limited compared to TouchDesigner. Moreover, they seemed more
            suited to musical applications, so I decided to leave them as simple experimental outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
            After resolving the issues, I started to play around with colors and parameters,
            applying what I had learned from various tutorials. Finally, following my
            instincts as a visual artist, I managed to make it look very attractive. I'm
            delighted that I was able to create it successfully!
