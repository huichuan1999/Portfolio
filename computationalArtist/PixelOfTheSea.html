            "Pixel of the Sea" artfully merges physical and digital realms. It features 25
            3D-printed virtual organisms submerged in acrylic boxes filled with a water and
            turpentine mixture on a 1m x 1m canvas. These installations, akin to biological
            microchips, are overlaid with switchable glass that imitating breathing and
            changes their visibility, reflecting an aesthetic that blends industrial grid
            measurements with circuit board designs.

            This work is a continuation of the project "The Lens of AI," where AI is
            visualized as a decomposer in cyberspace, breaking down complex fossil data into
            simpler digital forms. These fossils, sourced from Folkstone and Charmouth’s
            coastlines, underpin the work’s exploration of macroscopic and microscopic
            contrasts and AI’s preferences for structured data. This artwork invites viewers
            to consider the seamless integration of digital tools in understanding and
            reconstructing the natural world. Emphasizing themes of "future archaeology" and
            "archiving," the artwork positions these 3D structures as fossils in sand or
            meticulously archived specimens in the future, challenging perceptions of what
            is visible and what remains hidden in our increasingly digital landscape.

        <!-- <h3>Concept and Background Research</h3> -->
        <p>
            Are humans the measure of all things?
        </p>
        <p>
            We are far removed from the time when Plato first posed this question. As a
            computational artist, I have long been committed to integrating technology and
            art, positioning myself between the microscopic and the vast scales, exploring
            the juxtaposition of different elements and the interweaving of time. I strive to
            consider, from a de-anthropocentrism perspective, how we can organically shape a
            future vision alongside all things.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my previous project "The Lens of AI," artificial intelligence (AI) is
            envisioned as a digital decomposer, analogous to biological decomposers like
            fungi and bacteria that break down organic substances into simpler forms.
            In this video, AI decomposes the complex data structures of fossils, which
            symbolize ancient, seemingly immutable objects. These fossils, collected from
            the southern coastlines of Folkstone and Charmouth in the UK, are placed under
            a microscope camera. As the camera zooms in and out, the creatures, focusing
            on areas where the camera's clarity is highest, suggest AI's preference for
            'clean' and structured data, symbolizing its role in deconstructing complex
            structures previously deemed indestructible. The creatures cling to and animate
            the fossils, making them appear to twist and struggle, eventually disintegrating
            into a digital sea and breaking down into atomized pixels.
        </p>
        <p>
            This project prompted a renewed exploration into the concept of measurement. I visualized my artistic territory as a square canvas, with its side length representing a standardized unit within any given space. Accordingly, I encapsulated the AI-generated decomposer organisms within a 10cm by 10cm specimen box, positioning it on a 1m by 1m canvas.
            
            The intent is for the work to function as a foundational unit for constructing larger forms, embodying a sense of order, elegance, and potential for expansion. This modular approach suggests a framework that is standardized yet versatile, allowing continuous development.
