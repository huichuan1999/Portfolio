        <p>
            As a member of TTTB, I participated in discussions and curation, and design exhibition
            posters, labels, bar price lists, etc.
            <br>
            I also participated in the exhibition as one of the artists.

        <h3><br><br>Introduction<br></h3>

        <p>
            In April 2024, TTTB Artist-Run Space initiated an exhibition call for "Underground and Contemporary
            Shelters," with selected artists and artworks to be displayed around May 20, 2024, at the Park Art Space
            in Beijing. This exhibition unfolds from a month-long thematic discussion initiated by TTTB, involving 18
            artists and resulting in four online meetings. Throughout these discussions, we
            practiced the concept of "Slow Curating," which involves deep research, reflection, and thorough dialogue
            with each artist, exploring further possibilities of the theme and the interrelation between the artworks
            and the exhibition. "Slow Curating" reflects a reconsideration of the fast-paced exhibition models, focusing
            on scholarly depth and critical engagement rather than merely slowing down the process.
            <br><br>
            "Underground and Contemporary Shelters" seeks to explore the relationships between individuals and space,
            art, viewers, and artworks through a unique perspective and form. By integrating artworks with commonplace
            objects like cardboard boxes—commonly used for courier transport yet also serving as makeshift
            'Shelters'—the exhibition creates a special interactive display space for artists and viewers. Inspired
            by Fyodor Dostoevsky's "Notes from Underground," which profoundly examines themes of solitude,
            self-awareness, and resistance to being dominated by science and rationality, the exhibition delves deep
            into the introspective and societal implications of isolation. Here, the cardboard box serves as both a
            simple and symbolic medium through which artists express the relationship between the inner self and the
            external world.
            <br><br>
            Each artwork is displayed on the surface of a cardboard box, symbolizing the concept of a sanctuary while
            highlighting the accessibility and mobility of the art pieces. Visitors are invited to interact closely with
            the artworks, fostering deeper reflections on the relationships between individual spaces and the interplay
            between secrecy and the public sphere. Furthermore, viewers are encouraged to directly engage with artists
            within the exhibition, facilitating a more intimate appreciation and discussion of the original works. This
            approach aims to strengthen the connection between artists and viewers, breaking away from traditional
            viewing experiences and enriching the artistic encounter with personalization and depth.
